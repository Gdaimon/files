Guatemala Java Users Group -GuateJUG-
=====================================

Basic facts
-----------
GuateJUG started with our first meeting at March 03, 2011. At the beginning, JUG's meetings were coordinated by a team whose original members were Maria Castillo (@marycoder), Mario Batres (@mariobatres7) and VÃ­ctor Orozco (@tuxtor), since then the core team has only grown as the JUG grows :).

Currently our JUG is conformed by at least 580 members between developers, users, architects and enthusiasts. However as any other organization, we count as "active" at least 150 individuals that attend to our meetings and participate in the mailing list.

Activities and uniqueness
-------------------------
GuateJUG's members get together on a monthly basis, most of the occasions technical talks are alternated with informal (social) meetings to provide networking opportunities and grow the JUG's user base. Between the topics discussed at the meetings are:  
  
* Java tools and trends;
* Java launch events;
* Talks with special guests.


In addition to the regular meetings, our JUG hosts activities like:

* Presentations in Universities, incubators and other user groups;
* Socialization trips (yes, we also like to hike volcanoes!);
* A yearly conference denominated Java Day Guatemala, the biggest Java conference in Central America.  
  
In the last edition of Java Day Guatemala the attendance raised to ~500 individuals, a considerable number for a one day conference. The tendency for this year is to increase the attendance and we are getting ready for the event that will take place at October 11, 2014.

GuateJUG is recognized as one of the strongest developers groups in Guatemala, our country is experimenting a tech hype since it offers many facilities for outsourcing, software development, etc. In this context Java usage increased in government and educational organizations, so, Guatemala is becoming a great place to be a Duke's advocate.
